			<h1>Vocalocity OpenVXI Architecture</h1>
			<p><br>
				Vocalocity OpenVXI is a portable open source based toolkit that interprets the 
				VoiceXML dialog markup language. It is designed to serve as a component for 
				system integrators and platform vendors who want to incorporate VoiceXML into 
				their products.</p>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>A browser is a client application program that takes one or more input streams 
				on a platform and executes an application that lives on one or more document 
				servers by interpreting markup. In the case of VoiceXML, the application 
				consists of the call flow logic, the prompts for the application, and any 
				associated grammars (see figure below). The document server executes portions 
				of the application dialog by delivering VoiceXML markup to the browser in 
				response to a document request. The markup interpreter renders the VoiceXML 
				markup within an interpreter context, perhaps changing the context, and then 
				makes calls into the implementation platform. The implementation platform 
				contains all of the resources needed by the markup interpreter to render the 
				dialog. &nbsp;
			</p>
			<h2>Process Architecture</h2>
			<p>The figure below shows the components for a VoiceXML system. When a call is 
				received it is detected by the implementation platform. The platform sends an 
				event to the markup interpreter, which looks in its context for the URI of the 
				initial document to fetch. The interpreter then sends a Request to the Document 
				Server for the initial document. The Document Server then sends the document 
				back to the Markup Interpreter which then instructs the Implementation Platform 
				on the first steps to perform on behalf of the caller. The Markup Interpreter 
				then interprets the result of an execution in the Implementation Platform. The 
				interpretation may result in the Markup Interpreter making additional document 
				requests to the Document Server.
			</p>
			<h2>System Architecture</h2>
			<p>The figure also shows the system architecture where OpenVXI is integrated onto a 
				platform by adding speech engines, platform monitoring, administration, and 
				telephony interfaces. This integrated platform receives VoiceXML pages from a 
				document server. The document server consists of a web server, potentially an 
				application framework, and a VoiceXML application. The VoiceXML application can 
				be one or more VoiceXML files, or these files can be dynamically generated 
				using CGI scripts or other computations.
			</p>

			</p>
			<p>The implementation platform executes the VoiceXML pages to provide the speech 
				service to the caller connected over the telephone network. The implementation 
				platform logically consists of four parts:
			</p>
			<ol start="1" type="1">
				<li>
					<b>OpenVXI:</b>
				interprets the VoiceXML markup and calls into the platform services to render 
				the markup.
				<li>
					<b>Platform services:</b>
				provide the high-level services necessary for the system to run, including the 
				recognition engine, prompt engine, Internet fetch library, and ECMAScript 
				engine. OpenVXI accesses these components through interfaces that must be 
				implemented in order for the system to function. These interfaces do not define 
				the mechanism for communicating between the implementation of the interface and 
				the underlying software: this could be done using client/server protocols or 
				direct communication.
				<li>
					<b>Telephony and base services:</b>
				base operating system services and telephony services needed to receive phone 
				calls. OpenVXI makes few assumptions about the operating system and telephony 
				services, as it accesses them through replaceable interfaces.
				<li>
					<b>Main process and operations, administration, and maintenance system:</b> collection 
					of tools responsible for system management and error reporting.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>The figure above shows VoiceXML platform architecture and the component parts. 
				All components are designed to be portable across operating systems. OpenVXI 
				consists of:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					VXI<br>
					<br>
					Interprets all VoiceXML markup and acts as the main control loop. The VXI 
					implements all required portions of the VoiceXML 2.0 specification and most 
					optional features.<br>
					<br>
				<li>
					XML Parser Interface<br>
					<br>
					Provides access to a XML DOM parser, currently implemented by directly calling 
					the open source <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html">Apache Xerces 
						SAX and DOM parser APIs.</a><br>
					<br>
				<li>
					Internet Interface<br>
					<br>
					Provides access to application documents via http:// and file:// access, as 
					well as support for POSTing data back to the application server. The reference 
					implementation includes and implementation of this interface.<br>
					<br>
				<li>
					ECMAScript (JavaScript) Interface<br>
					<br>
					Provides access to ECMAScript execution services. The reference implementation 
					integrates the open source <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/">Mozilla 
						SpiderMonkey engine.</a><br>
					<br>
				<li>
					Logging Interface<br>
					<br>
					Used to report errors, events, and diagnostic messages to system operators. The 
					reference implementation logs to a file and optionally to standard output.<br>
					<br>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The implementation platform must provide the following resource interfaces:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Recognizer Interface<br>
					<br>
					Provides the grammar management and recognition services as required by the 
					VoiceXML specification, including dynamic grammar construction and grammar 
					enabling. It obtains caller input via the telephony services.<br>
					<br>
				<li>
					Prompt Interface<br>
					<br>
					Provides complete prompting services, including the ability to play "filler" 
					audio in order to support fetch audio. It must handle recorded audio (specified 
					by URI) and provide text-to-speech services, passing the returned audio to the 
					telephony services for playback.<br>
					<br>
				<li>
					Telephony Interface<br>
					<br>
					Provides call control services, including the ability to transfer and 
					disconnect calls as well as delivering telephony events.<br>
					<br>
				<li>
					Object Interface<br>
					<br>
					Provides access to objects, platform defined extensions to the VoiceXML 
					language that are accessed through the object element. Objects can easily be 
					defined to meet platform specific requirements for extended call control, CTI 
					screen pop, or other requirements.
					<br>
				</li>
			</ul>
